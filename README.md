# MyScalesApp
Android application for displaying music scales

This app is for musicians who don't want to spend time constantly looking up or memorizing the scales they want to play.
With this app, you just press the the button for which note you want, then press the button for which scale you want, and a text with all the notes in that scale will be displayed.
Currenlty, there are four scales to choose from: Major, Minor, Pentatonic Major and Pentatonic Minor.
There is also an option to add the Harmonic and Melodic notes to the Minor and Pentatonic Minor scales.
